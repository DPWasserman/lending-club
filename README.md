# Lending Club Loan Analysis

- A joint project by fellows of the New York City Data Science Academy

## Setup
- By running `import config`, a data folder will be created.
- Download `accepted_2007_to_2018Q4.csv` from [https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club]
- Place the downloaded file in the data folder.
- The code in the Jupyter Notebooks will execute as expected without error.
- Run the `Create_Working_DataFrame.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to create the working data file.
- You can see an example Jupyter Notebook in EDA/Sample_EDA.ipynb.
