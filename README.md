# Lending Club Loan Analysis

- A joint project by fellows of the New York City Data Science Academy

## Setup
- By running `import config`, a data folder will be created.
- Place the `accepted_2007_to_2018Q4.csv` file in the data folder.
- The code in the Jupyter Notebooks will execute as expected without error.
- You can see an example Jupyter Notebook in EDA/Sample_EDA.ipynb.

## Folder Structure
- **data**: Storage for the data used by EDA and the models
- **data_prep**: Jupyter Notebooks to manage getting the data and shaping it for analysis
- **EDA**: Jupyter Notebooks used to explore the data
- **lending_club**: Python package used by the Jupyter Notebooks
- **models**: Machine Learning models for predicting defaults
- **Project Proposal**: Background about the project
